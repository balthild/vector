Vector.js is a Javascript library for the creation of interactive graphics. The library uses the existing web standards: HTML, SVG, and CSS making it easy to use with other tools and libraries. At its core, the library is a minimalist tool for creating interactives. See the [Website](https://vectorjs.org) for getting started, examples, and more.
