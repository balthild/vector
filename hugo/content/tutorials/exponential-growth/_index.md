In this tutorial we will create an interactive map of the United States shown above. <!-- TODO: replace with actual interactive --> Each state will be colored with respect to its percentage of the total population of the country.

<!-- TODO: steps -->
<!-- Step 0: Open Editor  -->
<!-- Step 1: Load Map of United States -->
<!-- Step 2: Load Data from somewhere (spreadsheet?) -->
<!-- Step 3: Style States with respect to population -->
<!-- Step 4: Add a mouse click or mouse hover handler that displays information about each state. -->
